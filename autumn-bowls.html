      <h1>Autumn Bowls Recipe</h1>
      <p>These veggie and rice bowls are not only delicious, but they’re also cheap, easy and nutritious. It is a seasonal favorite for my friends and family and I usually get the ingredients for under 20 dollars TOTAL (not including the spices and oil). It’s enough to feed one person dinner for up to 5 days and you can easily chop the vegetables ahead of time and keep them in your fridge for up to a week. It makes it easy to throw it in a pan and go! </p>

     <p> First off, start out with preheating your oven to 350 degrees and wash your vegetables. </p>

         <h2>Squash</h2>
         <p> Peel and chop your squash into bite size pieces and throw them onto a baking sheet (lining the sheet with parchment paper or tin foil makes for easy cleanup). I swear this is the hardest part of the recipe! If you don’t know how to prepare a squash <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmvEhQFZno">here's a video to get you started!
        </a> *Pro tip* Microwave the squash for around 20 seconds. This will help to soften the fibers and make it easier to cut. </p>
