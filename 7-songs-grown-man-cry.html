          <h2> Whiskey Lullaby </h2>
          <h3>Brad Paisley ft. Alison Krauss </h3>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZbN_nmxAGk ">Listen to the song here</a></p>
          <p>This song tells the story of a soldier who came home after his deployment to find his one true love with
            another man. The soldier drinks himself to death and the woman later does the same out of guilt and regret.
            The song is an ultimate country depression jam that can most certainly get the tears flowing. </p>

">Listen to the song here</a></p>

          <p>A little trip over to the pop genre leads us to this ballad from Lewis Capaldi. The lyrics are inspired by the aftermath of suicide where friends and family of one who is lost are asking themselves what they could have done to prevent the tragedy. Is there anything a person can do to change another’s mind? </p>

          <h2>Sometimes </h2>
          <h3>Chelsea Cuter</h3>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csLX0FmRt_Q "> Listen to the song here</a></p>

          <p>Sometimes tells the story of a relationship ending because one person isn’t as committed as the other. Cutler affirms, “I love you but sometimes I’d rather die, then have to feel this way inside.” Wowzas. It’s intense and brutally honest. It may make your crazy Uncle Merv remember his long lost love. Who knows?

          <h2>Concrete Angel</h2>
          <h3>Martina McBride</h3>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtNYA4pAGjI"> Listen to the song here</a></p>

          <p>Concrete Angel is about an abused little girl who dies at the hands of her abuser. It says that a child who was forgotten, “flies to a place where she's loved.” It is gut-wrenching and not for the faint of heart. Get your tissues ready because it gets real. </p>

          <p>We are going to saunter our way back to Cutler for a song about her own struggles with mental illness. In this ballad, Cutler begs listeners for help with the battle she’s having with herself. The song says that she feels stuck as someone she is not who she is supposed to be. For anyone who has experienced mental illness, this song feels unbelievably raw. </p>

          <h3>We Three</h3>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtEupqhuWjs"> Listen to the song here</a></p>

          <p>We Three is formed by three siblings who lost their mom to cancer. The song summarizes their mom’s goodbye to their family saying that “Heaven’s not too far away, I hope someday you’ll visit.” This song hits home for anyone who has lost a loved one. </p>

          <p>Last but not least, we have Birthday Cake by Dylan Conrique. Conrique wrote this song after she watched her best friend grieve the death of her mother. The song implores the listener to enjoy their life because it is what their loved one would have wanted. It’s a real tear jerker. </p>
