          <h2> Whiskey Lullaby </h2>
          <p>By Brad Paisley ft. Alison Krauss </p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZbN_nmxAGk ">Listen to the song here</a></p>
          <p>This song tells the story of a soldier who came home after his deployment to find his one true love with another man. The soldier drinks himself to death and the woman later does the same out of guilt and regret. The song is an ultimate country depression jam that can most certainly get the tears flowing. </p>
